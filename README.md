# CS-330-OpenGL-Project
<h2>Final project for Computer Graphics Course using OpenGL. </h2> 

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This project served as the final assessment for CS 330 Computer Graphics and Visualization where I modeled a kitchen table utilizing glut, freeglut, glm, and SOIL2 libraries. 
  The project, which was completed over the course of the 8 week term, required textures and no more than 1000 triangles to be drawn, to keep the project manageable within the course time frame. 
</p>

<h3>Technologies</h3>
<p>C++, OpenGL</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>To run this project, install it locally and you will need to add dependencies in your project properties for freeglut, glew, glm, and SOIL2.</p>
